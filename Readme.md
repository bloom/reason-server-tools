# Reason Server Tools

A collection of modules written by Bloom Built (Day One) to ease the creation of Node.js servers in ReasonML.

Free to use however you like, under the MIT-0 license (attribution not necessary).

If you find that one of the modules isn't working how you'd like in it's current state, our advice is to [view the source](https://github.com/bloom/reason-server-tools/tree/master/src) and copy the module you like straight into your project, making whatever modifications you need for your current use case (you'll probably have to uninstall this module first, or name the copy something different.)
